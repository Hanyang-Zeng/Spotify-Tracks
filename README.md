## Introduction

This study uses the Spotify Tracks Dataset(https://hf-proxy-cf.effarig.site/datasets/maharshipandya/spotify-tracks-dataset) to analyse the distribution patterns of different audio features in the Spotify catalog. 

This study aims to systematically explore the distribution patterns of different audio features in the Spotify catalog. These features include tempo, energy, danceability, and key. The study also examines how these features relate to music genres and popularity. Previous research in Music Information Retrieval has made notable progress in connecting audio features with song classification and popularity prediction (Tzanetakis & Cook, 2002; Dhanaraj & Logan, 2005). However, there are still some limitations in how we measure the links among these features and their impact on listener preferences and market outcomes. This project seeks to address that gap by using visualization and statistical analysis on Spotify data. It aims to provide more empirical evidence for the music industry and academia.

## Research Questions

1. **What is the most popular music genre?**
2. **What are the audio characteristics of that music genre?**
3. **What is the relationship between audio characteristics and song popularity?**
